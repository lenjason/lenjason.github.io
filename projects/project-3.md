In the spring of 2016, I was approached by various faculty within the Leeward Community College's Informational and Computer Science department about helping out to create a student help desk for students of Leeward who needed technical help with their electronic devices.  To this end, I ended up helping to recruit and then manage a group of 7 students who create the student help desk from scratch.  Most of the orginization was centered on creating the framework and policies for how the student help desk would run.  As the student manager, I was in charge of getting all of the students involved, managing work schedules, setting timelines, and creating a policy manual.  Additionally, we needed to create and set up a physical space in which we were to provide service from.  This entailed managing a budget, creating purchase orders, inventory management, office layout design, and configuring network topologies for workstation placements.

Here is a copy of the <a href="https://lenjason/github.io/projects/helpDesk.pdf">Student Help Desk Policy Manual</a> that was created.
