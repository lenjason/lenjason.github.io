Monster Strike is like many mobile device games that have collectable monsters/characters with varying characteristics that pertain to the game.  The various user interface options we designed include searching through the Monsters, Dungeons, and other Strikers/Players using various user choosen chriteria.  For the project management, we incorporated various Gantt and PERT scheduling systems, a complete feasibility analysis (including: operational, technical, schedule, economic, legal, and political feasibility), dataflow diagrams (including: context diagrams and level 0 diagrams).  Within the executable we bundled self-extracting files that included: the database, an about file, an installation guide, a user manual, and a technical maintenance manual. 

For this project I was the team lead and complete over 60% of the work for this project including all of the manipulation of the MS Access Database and associatied user interface.  I also worte most of the technical maintenance manual documentation and about a third of the user manual documentation.
